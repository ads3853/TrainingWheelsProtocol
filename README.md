A set of Ansible scripts that can be used for Incident Response competitions by the Red Team to create low-hanging fruit for the Blue Team to find (and Red Team to exploit)

At the moment, while the tasks are seperated out, it is still a work in progress. In the meantime, the centralized.yml script is a full list of currently working tasks! To use, simply download and change the hosts field to your linux boxes, and it is good to be run!
